## ⭐ Why This Exists

Traditional financial advisors charge **1% of assets under management** every year — that's **$10,000/year on a $1M portfolio** for advice that's often a slide deck and a phone call.

A junior CFP costs **$2,000–$5,000** for a one-time plan. A fee-only fiduciary costs **$200–$400/hour**.

This tool gives you the same multi-dimensional financial analysis — cash flow, debt strategy, investment allocation, retirement projections, tax optimization, FIRE planning, estate gaps — **as a professional PDF report**, generated in **under 5 minutes**, **for free**, right inside Claude Code.

It does not replace a fiduciary advisor for execution, but it gives you the **diagnosis** and **prioritized action plan** that you would otherwise pay thousands for.

## 🤖 How It Works

When you run `/finance`, the orchestrator launches **5 parallel sub-agents** that each analyze one dimension of your finances:

1. **Cash Flow Agent** — income, expenses, savings rate, leverage opportunities
2. **Debt Agent** — payoff strategy, timeline modeling, interest minimization
3. **Investment Agent** — allocation analysis, drift detection, rebalance recommendations
4. **Retirement Agent** — gap analysis, contribution scenarios, projection modeling
5. **Protection Agent** — insurance audit, estate document review, emergency fund check

Each agent produces a scored sub-report (0–100). The orchestrator then **synthesizes** them into a single weighted **Financial Health Score**, plus a letter grade (A+ to F) and a plain-English signal (Excellent / Healthy / Fair / Weak / Critical).

The PDF generator (`generate_finance_pdf.py`, built on ReportLab) renders the final 9-page report with score gauges, horizontal bar charts, allocation pie chart, payoff timeline, and a prioritized action table.

## 📊 Example Output

Running `/finance` produces a **9-page professional PDF** (`FINANCE-PLAN.pdf`):

| Page | Content |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Cover** — Financial Health Score gauge (0–100), grade, signal, executive summary |
| 2 | **Score Dashboard** — horizontal bar charts for the 5 categories with notes |
| 3 | **Cash Flow** — income/expense table, savings rate, % of income breakdown |
| 4 | **Debt Summary** — accounts table, payoff timeline visual, total interest cost |
| 5 | **Investments** — allocation pie chart, current vs target, variance flags |
| 6 | **Retirement** — current vs target gap, progress bar, scenario comparison table |
| 7 | **Protection** — color-coded scorecard for life, disability, estate, emergency fund |
| 8 | **Top 10 Actions** — prioritized table by impact (High/Med/Low) |
| 9 | **90-Day Plan** — Month 1 (Foundation) → Month 2 (Acceleration) → Month 3 (Optimization) |

Every page carries a footer disclaimer and page number. The cover uses a half-circle gauge that's **color-coded green/amber/red** based on score band.
